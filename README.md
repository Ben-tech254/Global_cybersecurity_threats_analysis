**Tools used :** Python, pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib.

**INSPIRATION**

- In the recent years, there has been a rapidly increasing number of cyberattacks affecting not only individuals but also companies and institutions. Due to this, I developed the interest of analyzing this cybersecurity threats dataset.

**OBJECTIVES**
* Finding the most common cyberattack .
* Finding the most targeted industry.
* Identifying the cyberattack that results to the most financial losses.
* Identifying the cyberattack that affect a highest number of users.
* Identifying the most attacked country.
* Identifying the most common vulnerability type.
* Identifying the most commonly used defence system.
* Identifying the leading countries per cyberattack.
* Identifying the leading industries per cyberattack
* Finding if security vulnerability type affects the resolution time?
* Finding the cyberattack that has the highest average incident resolution time.
* Identifying the most active attack source.
* Identifying the most targeted industries per country.
* Identifying the most active attack source per country.

**RECOMMENDATIONS**
* Ensure that you install authentic antivirus softwares to your devices.
* Avoid public WIFI when you're doing sensitive tasks that involves confidential or sensitive information.
* Use VPN networks when surfing the internet.
* Avoid visiting sites that are not HTTPS sites.
* Use spam filters to spot phishing emails.
* Always update your OS(operating system), softwares and firmware to block exploit vulnerabilities.
* Always use strong passwords and enable multifactor authentication.
* Avoid saving your passwords in password managers, moreso those that can enable access to confidential documents or to bank accounts.
* Deploy and properly configure a firewall to block unauthorized traffic, filter malicious connections and segment networks thereby preventing cyber intrusions hence guaranteeing some safety.
